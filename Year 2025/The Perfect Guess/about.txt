A simple yet really fun game to play
It uses the built in random module to pick a number between 0 and 1000.
The user is asked to guess the number.
If the number is big, it is printed that the number is big, and the user is asked again.
If the number is small, it is printed that the number is too small and the user is asked again.
This continues until the user guesses the exact number.
At last the user is congratulated and told how many guesses it took him or her to guess the number.
