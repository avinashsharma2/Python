# About Jarvis Project

Jarvis is a smart virtual assistant built using Python that integrates the OpenAI API to provide intelligent replies. It is designed to handle a variety of predefined commands, and when it cannot find the appropriate command, it seamlessly falls back to the OpenAI API for generating responses. This combination allows Jarvis to be both a task-oriented assistant and a conversational AI.

## Features

- **Predefined Commands**: Jarvis can execute a set of predefined commands, such as opening websites and playing predefined music names in library.py
- **Fallback to OpenAI API**: When Jarvis does not recognize a command, it uses the OpenAI API to generate a response, enhancing its capability to handle a wide range of queries and conversations.
- **Easy Integration**: The project is built to be easily extensible, allowing you to add more predefined commands or adjust its interaction with the OpenAI API.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- An OpenAI API key
- A newsapi key

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avinashsharma2/Python/tree/main/Year%202025/Jarvis
   cd jarvis-project
   ```

2. Install the required packages using `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your OpenAI API key by replacing the gptapi variable in main.py
   ```
   gptapi="your_openai_api_key_here"
   ```
   Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual API key.

## Usage

Run the Jarvis script to start the assistant:
```bash
python main.py
```

Once running, Jarvis will listen for predefined commands or queries. If a query is not recognized, it will consult the OpenAI API to generate a response.

## Customization

You can add more predefined music by modifying the `library.py` file. Each command is defined as a function that Jarvis can call.
